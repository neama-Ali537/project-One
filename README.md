This is an unordered project summary:

I noticed there was a title above the header that seemed out of place, so I removed it.
I changed the header background color and adjusted the link colors. I also removed the underline from the links.
The second slide wasn’t well-arranged, so I reorganized it. I made the sidebar the second slide, and the article title the third slide.
I changed the sidebar's background color, adjusted the text and link colors, removed the underlines from the links, made the text bolder, and brought the two sidebars closer together. Finally, I opted for warmer colors.
The third slide contains the article title. It still needs further changes in the CSS file, particularly to position it at the bottom of the page. I also adjusted the color and ensured the article section is visually separated from the sidebar. Additionally, I chose a warmer color palette for the article section, which looks better than before.
The footer didn’t require many changes. I only added my name to it, separated it from the rest of the page, and positioned it at the bottom.
